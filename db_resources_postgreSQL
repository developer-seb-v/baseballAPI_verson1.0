create volume called "volume02" in docker desktop

go to terminal and enter command:
docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password123 \
-p 5432:5432 -v volume02:/var/lib/postgresql/data -d postgres

this creates a postgreSQL container with the name "postgres",
password=password123, specifies the port "5432", mounts the volume
for data persistence and finally, specifies which image you're pulling
"postgres"

You will need to run " dotnet ef migrations '<name of your migration>' " and "dotnet ef database update"
to populate the postgres DB with the Identity library-provided tables for authentication/authorization.
